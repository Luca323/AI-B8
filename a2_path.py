A* Algorithm 

The heurisitc within A* estimates how far the current state is from the goal
It does so by counting how many cells are different between them


It essentially guesses how many changes are needed to reach the goal
This helps the algorithm focus on states that are closer to the goal instead of exploring randomly
This makes the search faster and more efficient without sacrificing efficiency

We used Dijkstra's algorithm for min safe

The reason we use Dijkstra's algorithm is because we need to find a SAFE path with LOWEST total cost
Unlike other algorithms (BFS and DFS etc.) that minimise the steps, Dijkstra's minimises the total move cost
 
Essentially, Dijkstra's will return the cheapest overall path

Since each move in hinger can have a different cost (for example, reducing a higher number may cost more);
Dijkstra's is the most efficient and reliable choice
It expands paths in order of their total cost, guaranteeing the minimal- cost safe path if one exists

'''
We used Dijkstra's algorithm for min safe

The reason we use Dijkstra's algorithm is because we need to find a SAFE path with LOWEST total cost
Unlike other algorithms (BFS and DFS etc.) that minimise the steps, Dijkstra's minimises the total move cost
 
Essentially, Dijkstra's will return the cheapest overall path

Since each move in hinger can have a different cost (for example, reducing a higher number may cost more);
Dijkstra's is the most efficient and reliable choice
It expands paths in order of their total cost, guaranteeing the minimal- cost safe path if one exists
